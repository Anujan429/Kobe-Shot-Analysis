# Kobe-Shot-Analysis
Data Analysis and Predictive model to predict if Kobe's shot was made or missed
Dataset obtained through Kaggle.com for a competition from 2016 titled " Kobe Bryant Shot Selection"

My Project Objective: 
- Analyze the features of the dataset
- Clean the dataset
- Analyze the data through visualizations and comparison with other archived media such as videos and news articles about Kobe's performance 
- Starting point of building of a highly accurate predictive model to predict the outcome of Kobe's shot

- Random Forest used initially, 
- further work needs to be done to increase model accuracy
